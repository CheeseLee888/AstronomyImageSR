# SRCNN

This GitHub repository is an implementation of the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network originally introduced by Dong et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092).

## Requirements

- PyTorch 1.0.0
- Numpy 1.15.4
- Pillow 5.4.1
- tqdm 4.30.0

The code for files stability_study.py, models.py and utils.py was adapted from files SRCNN/Torch/train.py, SRCNN/Torch/models.py and SRCNN/Torch/util.py in the publicly available GitHub repository https://github.com/Fivefold/SRCNN (Copyright (c) 2021 Jakob Essb√ºchl, Philipp Lehninger, Benedikt Morgenbesser), accessed on 12.06.2023.

The repository additionally includes the training of the SRCNN model embedded in a stability scheme (stability_study.py) and an analysis of local stability of the model results in example images (local_stability.py). The Python-Notebooks srcnn_results_analysis.ipynb, srcnn_results_analysis_10.ipynb, and srcnn_results_analysis_10_0015.ipynb contain the analysis and creation of figures for the results obtained from the performed stability scheme.
