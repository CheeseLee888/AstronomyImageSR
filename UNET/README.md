# Python Implementation of UNET for image denoising

This GitHub repository is an implementation of the UNET with code adapted from the publicly available GitHub repository https://github.com/zaccharieramzi/understanding-unets, accessed on 12.06.2023 with direct permission from the repository's author Zaccharie Ramzi to adapt their code. 

The repository additionally includes the training of the UNET model embedded in a stability scheme (experiments/stability_study_tf.py) and an analysis of local stability of the model results in example images (experiments/local_stability.py). The Python-Notebooks unet_analysis_results_4.ipynb, unet_analysis_results_10.ipynb, and unet_analysis_results_0015.ipynb contain the analysis and creation of figures for the results obtained from the performed stability scheme.
